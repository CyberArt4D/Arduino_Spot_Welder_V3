Changes in V3.3

The Auto Pulse feature was improved. 
Many thanks to the Spot Welder user Arturs Jelohovskis for implementing this feature into the Arduino code.

What it does:
-added indication of probes shortcut on the screen
-added indication of delay BEFORE welding as progress bar (if probes are disconnecting during wait then AutoPulse stops)
-added indication of delay AFTER the welding pulse as progress bar.
