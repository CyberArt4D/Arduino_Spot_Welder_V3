Improvements in V3.3.1
- The Welder will now recognize if the foot switch is wired wrong and display an error message.

Description:
The foot switch needs to be used in no configuration, if it is connected in nc configuration (which means contacts closed when the switch is not pushed) an error message will be displayed during the start up of the spot welder.
