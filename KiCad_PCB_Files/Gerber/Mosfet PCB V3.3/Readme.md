These are the Gerber files for the Mosfet PCB V3.3. Please order it with 2oz copper layer at the pcb manufacturer because it needs to take a lot of current.

Improvements/Changes:

- Much wider traces on the bottom of the pcb for the high current connection to the u-shaped aluminum part
- Mosfet gate resistors directly on the mosfet board, very close to the mosfet gate pins
- All 8 Pins of the female 8 pin header that connects the Arduino and mosfet board are now connected to each other, which eliminates contact problems.
- compatible to all Spot Welder Arduino Boards V3 or later
